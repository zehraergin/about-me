                <p>
                    I went to Marseilles last summer with my paresnts, my sister and other family friends. We only stayed there for 2 days, but I loved it there becuase it is a port city, and was right by the sea. I also had the best tasting gelato. I alse loved walking through the streets fo Marseille and seeing the beautiful, old architecute and shopping. There were vey beautiful fountains and my favoitre shop was a small, cozy, cafe right near the water.
